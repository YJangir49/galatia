## Overview of libraries

 - Restful backend api implemented using `node.js` `express` framework. This backend is a proxy layer between UI and QPX Express Api. Having an api is useful to hide sensitive information from client side. (ex : Google Api Keys)

 - `lowdb` - super simple data access, a single json file for data storage

 - `create-react-app` - a starter boilerplate for client side React application

 - `redux` + `redux-thunk` - state management between components 

 - `normalizr` - normalized api result

 - `reselect` - memoized selector
